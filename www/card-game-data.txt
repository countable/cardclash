good parts of magic.
1. collectible, huge card variety.
2. deck building, surprising combos.
3. quick combat gameplay. the stack is interesting.

problems with magic.
1. mana screw.
2. waiting for my turn.
3. too much momentum and too few options, no way to make risky or costly moves in desperation to get key cards and be saved.

how to fix
1. burn cards for mana
2. simultaneous turns
3. dynamic combat
