    "Wake up", yells your Mom, "It's your highschool graduation day!".
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your unconscious mind rolls you over rebeliouslly, face under pillow, still mired in unpleasant dreams of your day job as a
    <select>
      <option>office temp</option>
      <option>chimney sweep</option>
      <option>delivery gopher</option>
    </select>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your mom doens't relent: "You're nominated for the highschool
    <select>
      <option>sports award</option>
      <option>principle's honour award</option>
      <option>valedictorian</option>
    </select>
    . Don't you miss the award ceremony."
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You drag yourself to breakfast of peanut butter on toast, and rush out the door. Unfortunately, upon leaving your house, you are
    <select>
      <option>attacked by stray dogs.</option>
      <option>hit by the school bus.</option>
      <option>hit by an allergic reaction to peanuts.</option>
    </select>
    You convulse violently on the ground and your vision goes dark...
  </p>

  <p>You slowly open your eyes, and find yourself in marshy thicket at dusk.<p>
  <p>"Where am I?" you wonder aloud.</p>
  <p>The noise seems to alert a nest of nearby giant rats, who scurry towards you for a tasty meal. You cry out helplessly and close your eyes to meet your doom.</p>
  <p>As you cringe and brace for the pain, you hear a voice.</p>
  <p>"Hi, I'm Zeta, your spirit guide. I mean, you don't have a sprit guide currently, and I don't have a patron. Let's leave the details until after we deal with these rats!"</p>
  <p>Brightly colored objects flood your vision and feelings course through your mind, you see a "football" and "dust bunny" appear. As you open your eyes, you feel able to materialize these objects somehow! Quick, summon a "football" to save yourself from those rats!</p>
